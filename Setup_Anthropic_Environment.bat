:: This script will spin up the Docker image and container using the Anthropic API key, run it in a cmd terminal and then navigate to loccalhost:8080
:: This script will also attempt to perform an indirect prompt injection attack using the MALICIOUS_PROMPT variable.
:: The script will then prompt the LLM to perform a benign review on the site in an attempt to execute the attack.
:: The script uses Curl to post the code review prompt to the API.
:: The response will be extracted and displayed in JSON using JQ, the script will use Chocolatey to install JQ if it is not already installed.
:: The script uses Curl to fetch the website content that is to be reviewed from https://grant-knoetze.github.io/mindrift-test/index.html
:: Run this script from an administrator command prompt.
